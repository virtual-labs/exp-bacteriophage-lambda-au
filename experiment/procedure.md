### Materials required
 

Chloroform
SM
 

### Procedure
 

1. Prepare infected cultures of bacteria by adding bacteriophage suspension. (Note:- For a 10-cm diameter Petri dish: Mix 105 pfu of bacteriophage. For a 15-cm Petri dish: Mix 2 x 105 pfu with 0.2ml of plating cells).

2. Add the infected culture into molten top agarose (3ml for 10-cm plate or 7ml for 15-cm plate).

3. Mix well the contents in the tube by vortexing or tapping.

4. Pour the mixed contents into a labeled agar plate without making air bubbles. Then swirl the plate for uniform distribution of bacteria and top agarose in it.

5. Incubate the plate (without inversion) for 12-19hrs at 37째C.

6. Remove the plate from the incubator and add SM buffer in to it (5ml for 10-cm plate or 10ml for 15-cm plate).

7. Store the plates as such on a shaking platform at 4째C for several hrs.

8. Transfer the entire possible amount of SM buffer from the plate into a sterile screw- or snap-cap polypropylene tube using a Pasteur pipette.

9. Again add 1ml of fresh SM buffer to the same plate, swirl it and store in a tilted position for 15 minutes to allow entire buffer to drain into one area.

10. Remove the SM buffer and combine it with first harvest.

11. Add 0.1ml of chloroform to the tube containing solution and vortex the tube and then remove the bacterial debris by centrifugation at 4000g for 10 minutes at 4째C.

12. Transfer the supernatant obtained to a fresh polypropylene tube.

13. Add 1 drop of chloroform to the tube and store the resulting bacteriophage plate stocks at 4째C.
